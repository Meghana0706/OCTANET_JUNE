                        Forests are vital to the planet's health. They act as the lungs of the Earth, absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. There are different types of forests, including tropical rainforests, temperate forests, and boreal forests, each with unique flora and fauna. Forests provide habitat for countless species and are crucial for maintaining ecological balance.
